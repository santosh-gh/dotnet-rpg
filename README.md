# .NET Core 3.1 Web API & Entity Framework Core Jumpstart

In this repository, you find the code for the online course [.NET Core 3.1 Web API &amp; Entity Framework Core Jumpstart](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-31-web-api-entity-framework-core-jumpstart/?referralCode=CA390CA392FF8B003518) on Udemy.

You will find all the explanations how to build and run this project [in that course](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-31-web-api-entity-framework-core-jumpstart/?referralCode=CA390CA392FF8B003518).

However, if you just want to have a quick look, I suggest you open this project with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), make sure to have the proper [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) installed and then in the terminal you enter `dotnet watch run`.

Then you will be able to run the web service calls against the URL `http://localhost:5000`.

If you have any questions or suggestion, feel free to [contact me](https://patrickgod.com).

Happy coding!
